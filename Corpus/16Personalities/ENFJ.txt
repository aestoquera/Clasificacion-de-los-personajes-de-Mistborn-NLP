A Protagonist (ENFJ) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals.

Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.Protagonists are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.

When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.Speaking Up for What’s Right
Protagonists tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. When something strikes them as unjust or wrong, they speak up. But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity and insight guide them to speak in ways that resonate with others.

These personality types have an uncanny ability to pick up on people’s underlying motivations and beliefs. At times, they may not even understand how they come to grasp another person’s mind and heart so quickly. These flashes of insight can make Protagonists incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicators.

Changing people’s minds is no easy task – but if anyone can do it, it’s Protagonists.
Protagonists’ secret weapon is their purity of intent. Generally speaking, they are motivated by a sincere wish to do the right thing rather than a desire to manipulate or have power over other people. Even when they disagree with someone, Protagonists search for common ground. The result is that people with this personality type can communicate with an eloquence and sensitivity that are nearly impossible to ignore – particularly when they speak about matters that are close to their hearts.

Getting Involved
When Protagonists care about someone, they want to help solve that person’s problems – sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for Protagonists’ assistance and advice. After all, there’s a reason that these personalities have a reputation for helping others improve their lives.

Protagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them happier than motivating other people to do what’s right.
But getting involved in other people’s problems isn’t always a recipe for success. Protagonists tend to have a clear vision of what people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make those changes. If Protagonists push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged. And while this personality type is known for being insightful, even the wisest Protagonists may sometimes misread a situation or unwittingly give bad advice.

Leading the Way
People with this personality type are devoted altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that they believe in. This strength of conviction bolsters Protagonists’ innate leadership skills, particularly their ability to guide people to work together in service of the greater good.

But their greatest gift might actually be leading by example. In their day-to-day lives, Protagonists reveal how seemingly ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care. For these personalities, even the smallest daily choices and actions – from how they spend their weekend to what they say to a coworker who is struggling – can become an opportunity to lead the way to a brighter future.Receptive – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.
Reliable – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.
Passionate – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.
Altruistic – These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.
Charismatic – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others.Unrealistic – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.
Overly Idealistic – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.
Condescending – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately.
Intense – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.
Overly Empathetic – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.Protagonists (ENFJs) can be intense when it comes to matters of the heart – and they wouldn’t have it any other way. People with this personality type rarely settle for anything that falls short of their ideals, and their romantic relationships are no exception.

Protagonists want to fall in love with the content of a person’s character and the tenor of their soul – not just the way they look from across the room.Although these personalities may come across as outgoing or even a bit flirtatious, few Protagonists are satisfied by fleeting attractions. Their standards are high, and they know it. In fact, this awareness might give Protagonists a deeper appreciation of just how rare and precious it is to feel a real spark with another person – and, in turn, just how rare and special it is when that spark grows into the steady flames of true, abiding love.

Moving Beyond the Dating Game
When Protagonists fall for someone, they tend to fall hard – and they’re not coy about it. Protagonists are among the personality types that most readily express how they feel, so they often find themselves making the first move, rather than playing games or waiting for reassurance that the other person feels the same way.

In the dating world, Protagonists’ willingness to put themselves out there can be refreshing and more than a little unusual. This, along with the intensity of their passion, is incredibly appealing to many people. That said, because Protagonists do so often make the first move, they may encounter their share of rejection as they search for a kindred spirit.

People with the Protagonist personality type are eager to prove their commitment, taking the time and effort to establish themselves as dependable, trustworthy partners.
Dreaming Together
Even on the first date, these personalities may steer the conversation toward weightier topics. Protagonists don’t just want to find out what TV shows someone watches – they want to get a sense of their partner’s dreams and aspirations, the changes they hope to make to themselves and to the world. And as the relationship deepens, Protagonists take pride in supporting their partner to make good on these dreams.

For Protagonists, one of life’s greatest joys is helping someone they care about reach their goals.
Some Protagonists carry this a step further, taking on their partner’s goals as their own. This can be problematic, to say the least. If Protagonist personalities become overinvested in helping their partner, they may end up neglecting their own self-care, hobbies, and friendships. They may also be at risk of pushing their partner to change their life in ways that they simply aren’t ready for.

When Protagonists carry this too far, they often find that the pressure they put on their partner to “better” themselves backfires in one of two ways. Their partner may become insecure, fearing that they aren’t good enough as they are, or they may become angry, feeling resentful of the implication that they need to change. Either way, Protagonists must learn to encourage their partner to grow without pushing too hard.

The Long Haul
Few personality types are keener than Protagonists to establish a loving commitment with their chosen partner. They take dating and relationships seriously. Even in the earliest days of a relationship, Protagonists tend to focus on long-term potential, and as the relationship matures, they want to do what it takes to bring that potential to fruition.

While Protagonists certainly know how to enjoy the moment, they also know that love isn’t all fun and games.
This can be a beautiful thing. Protagonists care about pleasing their partner, and their sensitivity helps them tune in to their partner’s shifting moods and desires. As long as they don’t lose track of their own needs, people with this personality type can enjoy incredibly rewarding relationships that are founded on trust, mutual support, and honesty – and, of course, love.Connecting with other people makes Protagonists (ENFJs) feel alive and purposeful. It’s no surprise, then, that they are anything but apathetic about friendship. Protagonists put sincere, dedicated effort into staying close with their friends. For these personalities, friendships are far from expendable or insignificant – instead, they’re a key component of a life well lived.A Wealth of Perspectives
Few personality types can match Protagonists’ sincere desire to get to know people. For Protagonists, discovering someone’s quirks and opinions and hopes and follies is one of life’s purest pleasures. Most Protagonists can’t help but be fascinated by other worldviews, even those with which they wholeheartedly disagree. Encountering a wealth of perspectives is what keeps life interesting for these types.

Protagonists surround themselves with all sorts of friends and acquaintances, including those whose experiences and ideas differ wildly from their own.
That said, most Protagonists find it difficult to respect anyone who takes shortcuts, disrespects others, or refuses to challenge the status quo. Instead, they find it easiest to connect with people who share their core ideals, particularly their commitment to doing the right thing and leaving the world better than they found it.

It is with these closest friends that Protagonists truly open up, sharing their vulnerabilities and their most precious dreams for their lives. These personalities maintain warm, caring, and supportive connections with many people, but they tend to show their full selves – including their insecurities – only to an inner circle of friends who have earned their trust.

Through Thick and Thin
Protagonists can be among the best friends anyone could wish for. Kindhearted and trustworthy, people with this personality type dedicate incredible amounts of energy and attention to their friendships. They want their friends to feel not merely validated but supported, not merely heard but understood.

From their closest friends to their wide circle of acquaintances, Protagonist personalities approach relationships with a sense of purpose, creating bonds that are not easily broken.
They can also be trusted to show up in ways both large and small – whether by taking time after a grueling day at work to help a friend spruce up their resume or by putting together a weekend-long destination birthday party for a friend who needs a boost. Nothing makes Protagonists happier than seeing the people they care about doing well, and few things could stop them from trying to help make that happen.

Finding Balance
While Protagonists enjoy lending a helping hand, they aren’t always happy with the results. The truth is that some people don’t have the energy or the drive to take full advantage of Protagonists’ offers of help – or they simply might not want to. For example, their friend might ignore that resume advice, or they might decide to kick back and relax instead of using that new resume to send out job applications.

When this happens, people with the Protagonist personality type may feel unappreciated, frustrated, or resentful. They may even become judgmental in an effort to push their friend forward – an approach that all too often backfires.

As they mature, many Protagonists learn to avoid taking their friends’ behavior personally.
Paradoxically, having a more flexible attitude can guide these types to support the people they care about even more effectively. As many Protagonists discover, the most enduring friendships are based not only on mutual growth but also on acceptance, compassion, and genuine respect.Protagonists (ENFJs) bring all of their gifts to raising children, including their compassion, their resolve, and even their leadership skills. As parents, they are guided by a deep sense of purpose. Specifically, they see it as their mission to help their children grow into their best, kindest, most capable selves.

To do this, Protagonists strive to create a loving, encouraging, and supportive home life for their children. Parents with this personality type promote creativity and authenticity, freeing their children to speak their minds and be themselves. For Protagonists, one of the greatest rewards of parenthood is watching their children blossom into their unique personalities.Life’s Most Important Lessons
This doesn’t mean that Protagonists adopt an “anything goes” mindset. Like all parents, these personality types occasionally pull rank and tell their children to do something “because I said so.” In their heart of hearts, however, Protagonists want to make sure that their children do the right thing out of understanding, not blind obedience.

Protagonist parents see it as their loving duty to help their children realize their unique potential.
These types usually set clear, age-appropriate rules and boundaries, so that their children understand the consequences of behavior that’s irresponsible or unkind. Even when Protagonist parents behave strictly, however, they do so out of love – in an effort to instill in their children strong values and a sense of personal responsibility.

Fortunately, these idealistic, good-natured parents can explain the difference between right and wrong in ways that uplift and inspire their children. And just as importantly, Protagonist personalities teach by example, modeling the kinds of behaviors that they hope their children will emulate.

Great Expectations
Parents with this personality type have high standards for their children. These expectations generally come with the best of intentions – Protagonists simply want to be sure that their children are on a path toward a meaningful, fulfilling life that makes good use of their potential.

Protagonist parents pride themselves on their ability to see what each person brings to the world – a trait that helps them recognize all the ways in which their children are gifted and capable.
At times, however, Protagonists’ expectations may seem overwhelming to their children. Children of Protagonist personalities may sometimes feel that they need to earn their parents’ love by meeting their standards – standards that might seem impossibly difficult to reach. In these situations, Protagonists may need to reassure their children that they are loved for who they are, not what they do.

A Bedrock of Support
Fortunately, Protagonists’ sensitivity helps them appreciate their children’s deeper needs, including the need for acceptance. Even as they urge their children to grow and learn and chase their dreams, parents with this personality type can offer a bedrock of emotional support that stays with their children for all their lives.

Whatever their children need in order to thrive, Protagonist parents dedicate the time and energy necessary to provide it.
As they mature, Protagonists’ children rarely lose sight of the genuine warmth, care, love, and encouragement that they received from their parents. These children tend to grow up with a deep appreciation for lessons that have been woven into the fabric of their character, including honesty, empathy, accountability, and the vital importance of doing the right thing.When it comes to choosing a career, Protagonists (ENFJs) find fulfillment in doing what they love most – helping other people. And with their creativity and drive, they can find ways to serve and uplift others in nearly any work environment, whether they’re behind a gleaming table in a corporate boardroom or behind the counter at a beloved local coffee shop.People with the Protagonist personality type rarely want for inspiration or opportunity in their search for meaningful work.
Earning Their Place
Thanks to their emotional intelligence and social skills, Protagonists can excel in nearly any people-oriented field, such as human resources, event management, recruiting, or public relations. That said, they tend to feel especially motivated in positions where they can guide others to learn, grow, and become more independent. Many people with this personality type gravitate toward careers with an altruistic bent, such as social work, teaching, counseling, coaching, health care, or public interest law.

Protagonists prove that a desire to serve others can be more than compatible with big ambitions.
Rather than fading into the background, Protagonists are known for their leadership abilities, and they often find themselves in positions of influence. These personalities can be found in public office and at the helm of all sorts of organizations – from nonprofits and religious groups to scrappy start-ups and corporate empires. They may also find themselves in jobs as consultants, advisors, and managers.

Wherever they work, Protagonists rarely lose sight of their core mission: to improve people’s lives. They intuitively pick up on the needs of their clients or customers, and then they draw on their creativity to meet these needs in innovative, unexpected ways. As a result, these types are able to bring sincerity, integrity, and even idealism to jobs in sales, customer service, marketing, advertising, and product development.

Finding the Deeper Issues
Focused and driven, people with the Protagonist personality type are always up for a good challenge. That said, certain challenges motivate them more than others. Work that is repetitive, isolated, or otherwise constrained can be frustrating for them. Protagonists want to see the impact they’re having, not to plug away at tasks all on their own.

In their heart of hearts, Protagonists want to witness the positive effects of their work – to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they’ve helped.
Protagonists feel fulfilled and energized by work that allows them to step back and reflect on the big picture. For these types, leaving a positive legacy is a key priority. This needn’t mean something as grand as solving world hunger (although, knowing Protagonists, it certainly could). But most people with this personality type do use their professional energy to resolve at least some of the deeper issues that their customers or colleagues face.

Versatile and insightful, Protagonists bring a wealth of strengths to their careers. At times, they may feel stuck or bored, wishing that their daily tasks could make more of an obvious difference in the world. But with their altruistic, creative spirits, these personalities almost inevitably find ways to use their work – whatever it might be – to contribute to the greater good.Protagonists (ENFJs) are warm, idealistic, charismatic, creative, and social. With this wind at their backs, these types can thrive in many diverse roles, at any level of seniority. Moreover, they are generally likable and good-natured – qualities that can propel them to success wherever they have a chance to work with others.

Protagonist Subordinates
As employees, Protagonists often push themselves to prove their merit and make a good impression on their managers. Perceptive and dedicated, people with this personality type can take on multiple responsibilities with competence and good cheer.

Protagonists are hardworking, reliable, and eager to help – but these strengths can become a double-edged sword.Unfortunately, some managers may take advantage of Protagonists’ work ethic by making too many requests or overburdening them with extra work. Although these personalities are more than capable of standing up for themselves, they may still accept all of these additional tasks in order to keep the peace and avoid letting others down.

Protagonist Colleagues
As colleagues, Protagonists stand out for their desire to collaborate. They are always on the lookout for opportunities to create win-win situations and help their coworkers reach their full potential. These personalities foster equitable team environments where everyone – whatever their job title – can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas.

Protagonists’ tolerance and easy sociability makes it easy for them to relate to their colleagues.
That said, Protagonists’ tendency to take charge may sometimes ruffle their coworkers’ feathers. With their strong drive to lead, Protagonists may sometimes be tempted to make decisions or suggest changes that go beyond the scope of their authority – leading their colleagues to ask, “Hang on, who put you in charge?”

Protagonist Managers
Many Protagonists feel called to roles as managers and leaders. With their charisma, their insight, and their inspiring way of expressing themselves, people with this personality type often shine when given the opportunity to lead a team – and they make sure that their team shines as well.

As managers, Protagonists make the people who work for them feel not just motivated but also inspired.
These types tend to see each member of their team as a person with important gifts and unique potential. As a result, working for a Protagonist can feel meaningful and exhilarating – it’s a chance to develop as a person as well as an employee.

That said, Protagonists’ idealism may prevent them from recognizing the real limitations of their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may give team members assignments that they simply aren’t ready for – an approach that all too often backfires. Fortunately, Protagonists can use their emotional intelligence and personal judgment to find a balance between encouraging their employees to grow and pushing them too far.What you have read so far is just an introduction to the complexities of the Protagonist (ENFJ) personality type.
